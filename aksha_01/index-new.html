											<h1>Opinion</h1>
											<p>
												The status of India's national health presents many reasons to be optimistic. Results from the last
												National Family
												Health Survey 2015 - 2016 (NFHS-4) has shown declining trends in key health indicators like Infant
												Mortality Rate (IMR)
												and Under-five Mortality Rate (U5MR). The government is also making a concerted effort towards bridging the
												healthcare
												access gap by focusing on low-income and marginalized communities across the country, previously unreached
												by quality
												healthcare services.
												<br><br>
												Technology-based interventions that enable real-time access and allow for ‘here-and-now’ review of the
												impact of health
												programs, are being deployed and are expected to be game-changing. Further, the high priority given to
												building an
												improved sanitation eco-system – a prerequisite for a healthy India - is underway.
												<br><br>
												But much more needs to be done if ambitious national health outcomes are to be realized. These include,
												amongst others,
												enabling good health and nutrition for children to ensure they reach their full intellectual capability as
												well as
												focusing on eliminating diseases that disproportionately affect the poor such as tuberculosis and lymphatic
												filariasis.
												<br><br>
												What will it take to get there? Where will the resources come from? And which are most the effective ways
												to improve
												health and reduce poverty?
												<br><br>
												Here is a thought-provoking article by <span class="blue-bold">Bill Gates (first published in the Wall
													Street Journal)</span>, that talks
												about proven
												strategies in health interventions and the urgent need for governments around the world to continue to
												invest in them
												so that momentum built in saving previous lives is not lost.
