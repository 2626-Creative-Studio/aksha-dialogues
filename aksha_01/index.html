												The status of India's national health presents a number of reasons to be optimistic. On several key health indicators,
												India has made significant gains over the years. Results from the last the National Family Health Survey 2015 - 2016
												(NFHS-4), that captures information on population, health and nutrition for India, have shown declining trends in
												Infant Mortality Rates (IMR) and Under-five mortality rate (U5MR) rates.
												<br><br>
												The government’s effort towards bridging the healthcare access gap for the poor and vulnerable families through
												financial protection is promising. The focus on technology-led interventions that enable real time access to services
												and data, and allow for ‘here-and-now’ review of impact of programs and interventions, can be game changing.
												<br><br>
												Here are two interesting articles that describe the progress being made on specific challenges in areas that are
												critical to improving healthcare in India:

												The demographic dividend, defined as the economic growth potential resulting from favourable shifts in population age
