                      <h1>Opinion</h1>
                      <p>
                        India’s health, economic prosperity and social development are closely interconnected. Over the
                        years, the
                        country has
                        made significant gains on this front. We are witnessing declining trends in Infant Mortality
                        Rates (IMR)
                        and Under-Five
                        Mortality Rate (U5MR) – key proxies for a nation’s health status. Polio-free in 2014, India has
                        now rolled
                        out an
                        intensified mission to improve vaccine coverage. Technology-based interventions, in areas like
                        TB
                        detection, that
                        enable ‘here-and-now’ review of a health program’s impact, are in place. Frontline health
                        workers are being
                        equipped
                        with digital tools to monitor nutrition levels and provide a real-time report on the health of
                        their
                        communities.
                        Building an improved sanitation eco-system – a necessity for sustained improvement India’s
                        health - has
                        also been
                        prioritized in recent years. These new initiatives and technology-based approaches to
                        healthcare are
                        expected to be
                        game-changing and give us many reasons to be optimistic.
                        <br><br>
                        But much more needs to be done if ambitious national health outcomes are to be fully realized.
                        These
                        include, among
                        others, enabling good health and nutrition for children to ensure they reach their full
                        intellectual
                        capability;
                        focusing on eliminating diseases such as tuberculosis, that disproportionately affect the poor;
                        and a
                        continuous effort
                        to close the access, affordability and quality gap in health services for the poor and
                        marginalized
                        communities across
                        India.

                        What will it take to step up the gains made so far? Where will the resources come from? Which
                        proven
                        strategies can be
                        scaled so that they reach more people and save more lives? Here is a thought-provoking article

                        poverty. The write up also highlights that governments must continue to replenish investments
                        in successful
                        interventions so that the progress made on national and global health agendas remain on course.
