												India has made sustained progress in the battle against TB and Multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB). In 2012,
												TB
												notification was made mandatory and till date, nearly 20 million patients have been treated under The
												Revised National
												TB Control Programme (RNTCP) – the country’s flagship program to tackle TB. Incidence rates were reduced
												from 289 per
												lakh per year in 2000 to 217 per lakh per year by 2015 and the mortality due to TB has reduced from 56 per
												lac per year
												in 2000 to 36 per lac per year in 2015.
												<br><br>
												India is also leveraging technology in the fight against TB. The RNTCP uses the NIKSHAY platform - an ICT
												enabled
												state-of-art surveillance system which is set up to get notification of TB cases at diagnosis. This web
												enabled and
												case based monitoring application tracks cases reported from both public and private sector.
												<br><br>
												However, despite this progress, India still accounts for one-fourth of the global TB burden and is also
												among the ten
												countries with the largest gaps between notifications of new and relapse (incident) of TB cases. Timely
												detection,
												particularly from the private sector where most of the patients first seek care, continues to pose a
												challenge. Of the
												40% of TB cases are catered to by the private sector, data shows that nearly half of them are still missed
												by the TB
												notification system. Further gaps in tackling TB/MDR/RR-TB as well as HIV associated TB also remain
												significant.
												<br><br>
												For India to eradicate TB by 2025, a continuous, sustained and collaborative effort is required. Further,
												gaps in
												diagnosis and treatment interventions, as well as leveraging of technology to tackle this challenge must be
												made a
												priority.

												Here are two articles talking about what it will take to eradicate TB – particularly by working with the
												private sector
												where most TB patients are treated.
