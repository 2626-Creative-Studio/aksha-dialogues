												India has made sustained progress in the battle against TB and Multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB). In 2012,
												TB notification was made mandatory and till date nearly 20 million patients have been treated under The
												Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCPTB) – the country’s flagship program to tackle TB. Incidence
												rates were reduced from 289 per lakh per year in 2000 to 217 per lakh per year by 2015 and the mortality
												due to TB has reduced from 56 per lac per year in 2000 to 36 per lac per year in 2015.
												<br><br>
												India is also leveraging technology in the fight against TB. The RNTCP uses the NIKSHAY platform - an ICT
												enabled state-of-art surveillance system to get notification of TB cases at diagnosis from both public and
												private sector including drug- resistant TB patients.
												<br><br>
												However, despite this progress, India still accounts for one-fourth of the global TB burden and is also
												among the ten countries with the largest gaps between notifications of new and relapse (incident) of TB
												cases. Timely detection, particularly from the private sector where most of the patients first seek care,
												continues to pose a challenge. Of the 40% of TB cases are catered to by the private sector, data shows that
												nearly half of them are still missed by the TB notification system. Further gaps in tackling TB/MDR/RR-TB
												as well as HIV associated TB also remain significant.
												<br><br>
												For India to eradicated TB by 2025, continuous, sustained and collaborative effort, which identifies and
												closes the gaps in diagnosis and treatment interventions, as well as intensifies leveraging of technology
												to tackle this challenge must be made a priority.
